			<h2>Finish Line Management</h2>
			<p>
				We can provide two Lynx System cameras for your finish line. The FinishLynx camera is
				accurate to 1/2000th of a second and produces high quality images to eliminate any
				discrepancies in determining the order of finish. The IdentiLynx video camera is also
				available for reading bib numbers in cross country races or longer race distances on the
				track.

				at the conclusion of the meet. Team scores are tallied after each event. Complete results
				are uploaded to
				<a href="https://www.athletic.net">Athletic.net</a> and posted to our website. Upon request,
				results can be submitted to media outlets.

				each event is completed. Coaches and spectators can also view these same results from their
				smartphone. Upon request, any event information can be included as well.

				heat/flight sheets, and can handle advancement procedures from prelims to finals. All

				meet director prior to the meet date. We can provide printed copies of heats/flights the day
				of the meet, as well.
